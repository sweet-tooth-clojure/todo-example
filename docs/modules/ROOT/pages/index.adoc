= Sweet Tooth Todo Example =
Daniel Higginbotham


Get a _taste_ of what it's like to work with Sweet Tooth, a single-page app
framework for Clojure! I'll guide you through many of its features by taking you
on a depth-first walk through a single action: creating a new to-do list in a
simple to-do list app.

TODO: include an overview here.


== Preamble ==

=== What is Sweet Tooth? ===
My dream for Sweet Tooth is to make it easier, faster, and funner for
developers like you to get your ideas into production.

Swet Tooth does this by giving you the tools to deal with common SPA concerns
like handling forms, configuring routing and navigation, and managing API calls.
These use cases are not particular to the app you're trying to build, but as a
Clojurian you've likely had to figure them out for yourself when building an
SPA. In the same way that you shouldn't have to write your own filesystem when
making a desktop app, you shouldn't have to write your own form handling system
to launch your cool idea. (BTW - word on the street is in the 80's a new OS
would the street https://twitter.com/GeePawHill/status/1256342997643526151[every month or so], supporting my thesis that operating systems
are frameworks.)

I've tried to write Sweet Tooth so that using it doesn't lock you into some
weird, arcane world the way some frameworks do. It's built on top of popular and
proven libraries like re-frame, duct, integrant, liberator, ring, and reitit,
and you can always use those libraries directly if you need to.

The analogy I've had in mind is taken from the way we use files: files can be
structured as text, text can be structured as JSON, and JSON can be structured
as transit. Each additional degree of structure gives you added power while
requiring more special-purpose tools. Your XML tools won't work on a JSON file.
However, you can still use the lower-level tools; `sed` and `awk` work just
fine. For more on my underlying approach to framework development, see
http://flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/why-programmers-need-frameworks/[Frameworks and Why (Clojure) Programmers Need Them]

Eventually, I'd like to make it dramatically easier for beginners to make cool
stuff and show it to their friends and family. For that reason, I haven't put
any effort into making use of tools like GraphQL which can be quite powerful but
harder for beginners to grok and which, in my opinion, many apps don't need.


=== What isn't Sweet Tooth? ===
Sweet Tooth is not for creating server-rendered apps. It hasn't been
used for high-traffic projects, so it's currently not for that,
either.


=== Target Audience ===
This README has been written for people who have written at least one
Clojure web app. It assumes knowledge of web app development; it is
not intended for complete for beginners. (Maybe one day I'll write
that!) In particular, I'll refer to Integrant and re-frame concepts
and explain them only briefly, if at all.

I dive into Sweet Tooth internals more than I would in a tutorial that
was focused solely on building stuff with the framework because you're
experienced and I'm hoping to reveal some of its design and get your
valuable feedback :)


== Walkthrough ==
For the rest of this doc I'll show you Sweet Tooth's ideas and
features by walking you through what happens when you create a to-do
list. First, get the app running:

. In a terminal, run `npm install` then `shadow-cljs watch dev`
. Start a REPL. If prompted to choose between `lein`, `clojure-cli`,
and `shadow-cljs`, choose `lein`.
. Evaluate `(dev)` in the REPL. The REPL will pause for a little bit
while it thinks.
. Evaluate `(go)`.

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] and you should see
something like this:

Now, create a to-do list by entering its title and hitting enter or
clicking the "create to-do list" button. You should see a little
activity indicator appear for a split second, then you should get
redirected to your newly-created to-do list. The URL should have
changed to something like
`http://localhost:3000/to-do-list/17592186045431`.

In even these two simple steps there's a lot going on, including:

* Initial rendering
** App initialization
** Route handling for the URL `http://localhost:3000/`
** Rendering the "home page"
* Form handling
** Managing the input for the to-do list title
** Submitting the form
** Displaying an activity indicator
* API request handling
* Frontend response handling
* Navigating to the new to-do list

Let's dig in!
