= Sweet Tooth To-Do Example Walkthrough =
Daniel Higginbotham


Get a _taste_ of what it's like to work with Sweet Tooth, a single-page app
framework for Clojure! I'll guide you through many of its features by taking you
on a depth-first walk through a single action: creating a new to-do list in a
simple to-do list app.


== Target Audience ==
This walkthrough has been written for people who have written at least one
Clojure web app. It assumes knowledge of web app development; it is not intended
for complete for beginners. (Maybe one day I'll write that!) In particular, I'll
refer to Integrant and re-frame concepts and explain them only briefly, if at
all.

I dive into Sweet Tooth internals more than I would in a tutorial that was
focused solely on building stuff with the framework because you're experienced
and I'm hoping to reveal some of its design and get your valuable feedback :)


== First Steps ==
For the rest of this doc I'll show you Sweet Tooth's ideas and features by
walking you through what happens when you create a to-do list. First, get the
app running:

. In a terminal, run `npm install` then `shadow-cljs watch dev`
. Start a REPL. If prompted to choose between `lein`, `clojure-cli`, and
`shadow-cljs`, choose `lein`.
. Evaluate `(dev)` in the REPL. The REPL will pause for a little bit while it
thinks.
. Evaluate `(go)`.

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] and you should see
something like this:

Now, create a to-do list by entering its title and hitting enter or clicking the
"create to-do list" button. You should see a little activity indicator appear
for a split second, then you should get redirected to your newly-created to-do
list. The URL should have changed to something like
`http://localhost:3000/to-do-list/17592186045431`.

In even these two simple steps there's a lot going on, including:

* Initial rendering
** App initialization
** Route handling for the URL `http://localhost:3000/`
** Rendering the "home page"
* Form handling
** Managing the input for the to-do list title
** Submitting the form
** Displaying an activity indicator
* API request handling
* Frontend response handling
* Navigating to the new to-do list

Let's dig in!
